            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And although ſome fooliſhe heades of fanſie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, think this arithmeticall arte pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier onely to a fewe vſing the trade of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundiſe, as though it were not ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for other men: Yet I am ſure, the wiſeſt and beſt learned perceiuing the wonderfull arte, the deepe diuiſes, and the cunning co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
<pb facs="tcp:183994:3"/> that are compriſed in it: affyrme it (and that of right) to be the beſt whetſtone, or ſharpening of the witte of euery man, that euer was inuented, and thinke it moſt neceſſarye to be taught vnto children, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which, nothing either priuate or common can be well ordered. And trewe it is, that whoſoeuer is ignoraunt of thys ſcience of numbring, he ſlepeth in all the reſt, and lacketh that promptitude of witte, which other haue in caſting and accompting of great ſummes. Yea, I ſaye hee that hath the exacte knowledge of it, hath a ſpeciall gift of GOD, and carieth about him a note and token of a good wit: and I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer anye was counted or eſtemed ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or fooliſhe, that had this ſcience in hys heade.</p>
            <p>Nowe if ſome curious braine woulde aske mee thys queſtion: Syr you commende much your Arte of numbring, can you tell who was the firſt inuentor of it, or what this worde ARITHMETICA doth ſignifie, I would aunſwere him that it is vncertaine who inuented it firſte, but well I knowe,
<pb facs="tcp:183994:4"/> it is one of the ſeuen liberall ſciences: which if I ſaye God gaue vnto man to adourne his life with all, I ſay as it is, and as we ought to beleue, of whom we acknowledge to haue receiued them and not of the Poetes or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Goddes, as ſome ſcholemen will ſaye. Moreouer, I know that Abraham taught it firſt vnto the Egiptians, and no man will denie but that he receiued al his knowledge of God, for he worſhipped no ſtraunge Gods neither receiued anye giftes or ſciences of them. And although many yeres after, Pythagoras declared it to the Greekes, yet was not he the firſt inuentour of it, but god. Plato alſo commended it as moſt neceſſary, willing it to be taught to all youth before al other thinges. And thankes be to God, it appeareth that his precept hath been verye well followed here in Englande, for I finde not in anye nation (I ſpeake not flattering my countreymen but commending them) more ready knowledge in this ſcience, than there is in the moſte part of our youth here in Englande, and namely in London, which I ſeing it is in them, it is (out of queſtion) in their maiſters &amp; tutours, which by their great care ouer them, haue trained them
<pb facs="tcp:183994:4"/> vp vnto the practiſe thereof, to whom the greateſt part of the praiſe redoundeth. And now right worſhipfull, when I conſider how little profit my ſimple trauaile ſhall bring, being but as it were an aſſay of further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, I am compelled to craue at your handes onely to accept my good will with the worke: for will and abilitie are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vnequall in mee, but if abilitie were correſpondent to will, I woulde gladlye plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you in greater things tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this is, which is but only a ſhadowe in compariſon of other mens ſubſtanciall labour &amp; trauail in this art: yet I truſt it is not altogither ſo vnpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but it hath paſſed vnder the file of ſome workmanſhip, wherby ſome men may take occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of profit &amp; furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce herein, which is my chief deſire, although I knowe many are able to doe better: for Englande is not ſo deſtitute of learned heades, but my doings may ſone be followed, yea rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. But yet foraſmuch as I would they ſhould knowe, that knowe not, I thought it not good to hide that which hath been ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto mee. And ſo caſting with my ſelfe the ſumme of all, I deſire you eftſones, right worſhipful (to whom I thought it moſt mete

            <p>Thus fare you well, deſiring God to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine you in your eſtate, to proſper and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all your good purpoſes, all your trafficks and voyages, encreaſe you in vertue, and keepe you in good health. </p>

                  <p>Alſo you ſhall vnderſtande that euerye one of theſe fygures hath twoo values: One is alwaye cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and hath hys ſignification of hys owne forme, and the other is vncertaine which hee taketh of his place.</p>
                  <p>A place is called the ſeate or rome that a figure ſtandeth in,<note place="margin">A place.</note> and howe many figures ſoeuer are written in one ſumme <add>or number</add>, ſo manye places hath the whole value therof. And that is called the firſt place (which nexte is towarde the ryghte hande) of anye ſumme, and ſo reckning by order towarde the lefte hand, ſo that that place is laſt which is nexte the lefte hande. And contrarywyſe, when you expreſſe the value of the fygu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in any ſumme, you muſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne at the lefte hande, and ſo recken toward the right hand.</p>
                  <p>Euerye of theſe nyne fygures, (which are called ſignifying fygu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res) hath his own ſimple value whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:183994:7"/> hee is founde alone, or in the firſt place of any ſumme. In the ſeconde place towarde the left hande, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth his own value ten times. As 70. is, ſeuen times ten: that is to ſaye ſeuentie. 80. is eyght tymes ten: that is to ſay eyghtie. In the third place euery figure betokeneth hys owne value a hundreth tymes. As 700. in that thirde place betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a hundreth times 7. that is to ſay, ſeuen hundred: In the fourth place euerye figure betokeneth hys owne value a thouſande times. As 7000. is ſeuen thouſande, and 8000. is eight thouſande. Theſe foure firſt places muſt be had perfectly in minde, yea and that by heart, for by the knowledge of them you maye expreſſe all kinde of numbers how great ſo euer they bee.</p>
                  <p>In the fift place euery figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth his owne value ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times. As 70000. is ten times ſeauen thouſande, that is to ſaye
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:183994:7"/> ſeuentie thouſande: In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixt place euery fygure ſtandeth for his owne value, a hundreth thouſand times. As 700000. is ſeuen hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande. The ſeauenth place M. M. times, or a million: as 7000000. is ſeuen M. M. or ſeuen millions. And the eyght place ten M. M. times, or ten millions, ſo that euery place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the left hande, excedeth the former ten tymes. But nowe for the eaſy reading, and redye expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing orderly of any ſumme propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, you ſhall practiſe thys maner, folowing. And for example I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone this number 765432658. in the which are .ix. places. In the fyrſte place is .8. &amp; betokeneth but eyght, in the ſeconde place is 5. and beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth ten times fiue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is fiftye, in the third place is 6. and betokeneth a hundreth times ſixe, that is vj. C. In the fourth place is 2. and that is twoo M. And 3. in the fifte place is ten M. times 3. that is xxx. M. So .4.
<pb facs="tcp:183994:8"/> in the firſte place is C. thouſande times 4. foure, that is foure. C.M. then .5. in the ſeuenth place is a M. M. times 5. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is fiue M.M. or rather fiue millions. And 6. in the eyght place is ſix times ten millions, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is lx. millions. And laſt of al .vij. in the ix. place, is vij. C. millions. Now fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practiſe. Firſt put a pricke ouer the fourth figure, and ſo ouer the ſeuenth, and likewiſe ouer the tenth. And alſo ouer the 13.16. or .19. if you had ſo many, and ſo ſtill lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing twoo figures betweene euerye twoo pricks and theſe roomes from one prick to an other are called ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,<note place="margin">Ternaries.</note> then you muſte pronounce euery three figures from one pricke to an other as though they were written alone from the reſt. And at thende of their value, adde ſo many times a thouſand, as your number hath pricks (that is to ſay, if there be but 1. prick, it is but 1. M. if 2. pricks a M.M. or elſe a million, if 3. prickes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:183994:8"/> M.M.M. or a M. million, &amp; ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tli of al other figures folowing) Then come likewiſe to the next iij. fygures, and ſound them as if they were a part from the reſt, and adde to their value ſo many times thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes as there are pricks betwene them &amp; the firſt place of your whole number. And ſo doe by the next iij. figures folowing &amp; of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as in example. 451234678567. The firſt prick ouer 8. in the fourth place, which is the place of a M. the ſeconde pricke is ouer 4. in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth place, which is the place of a M.M. or one million, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirde prick is ouer the tenth place which is the place of a M.M.M. or of a M. milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in the former example. Then for the expreſſing of thys number by the value of euery figure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the place wherein they ſtande, you ſhall fyrſte begynne at the laſt prick ouer 1. and take it and the other twoo fygures 5. and 4.
<pb facs="tcp:183994:9"/> which doe folowe hym, and value them alone and they are foure Clj. MMM. or elſe CCCCli. M. milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Then take the other three fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures from 1. to the next pricke, and value them as if they were a parte from the other, and they are .234. which are CCxxxiiij. millions, or 234. MM. Then come to the thirde prick ouer .8. and take the other two figures behinde it, and recken them likewiſe as if they were alone, and they are ſixe Clxxviij.M. And laſte of all come to the other thre figures which remayne, that is .567. and they are fiue Clxvij. Thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ſum of theſe figures, is four Clj.M. two Cxxxiiij. millions, ſix Clxxviij. M. fiue Clxvij, as before.</p>

                  <p>IN multiplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there are iij. numbers to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay the numbre which is to be multiplied, the which wee will call the Multiplicande: and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by the which we multiplie, wee call the multiplyer, or multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirde number is that which commeth of the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one by the other, which is called the product. As when I would know how much mounteth 10. multiplied by 9. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay how much are ten times nine. I fynde that they are worth. 90. then 10. is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multiplicand, 9. is the multiplier.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:183994:17"/>
                  <p>And 90. is called the product. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to multiplie, is none other thing, but to finde a number which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth the multiplicande ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, as the multiplier contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnities, As 10. multiplied by 9. doe make 90. as before ſaid. And 90. conteineth 10. ſo many times, as 9. conteineth vnities, that is to ſaye nine tymes.</p>
                  <p>In multiplication, it forceth not much which of the twoo num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers bee the multiplicande, nor which bee the multiplier. For ten multiplied by 9. maketh as many as 9. multiplied by 10. yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it ſhall be more commodious that the leſſer number be alwayes the multiplier.</p>
                  <p>And for that, that the multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of figures the one by the other, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt chief &amp; neceſſarieſt kind wherby to know how to work in the multiplication of compound numbers, and that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. When you would multiplye two ſimple figures, or digets y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one by the other, abate eche of thoſe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get numbers from 10. Then mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie the two remaines the one by the other. And if the ſum do exceede 10. write only the firſt figure, &amp; kepe the other to be added to the next o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, which is thus. Adde your two ſimple figures togither: And of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which reſulteth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> addition, take onely the firſt figure, vnto the which you muſt add y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnity which you keepe before. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall be the ſecond figure of the ſum which you do ſeeke. Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, I would multipli 7. by 6. I take 7. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 10. and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth 3. likewiſe I abate 6. from 10. and there reſteth 4. then I ſay thus 3. times 4. make 12. I write 2. for my firſt figure, &amp; I keepe 1. in my mind, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I adde 6. w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 7. &amp; they are 13. of the
<pb facs="tcp:183994:18"/> which I caſte away the ſeconde fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure 1. and I take only the fyrſt fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure 3. vnto the which I adde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which I kepte, &amp; they make 4. which I write in the ſeconde place, after 2. And thus I finde 42. which is the valure of 7. multiplied by 6.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, and all commeth to one effect, ſet down your two diget numbers the one right ouer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; right againſt euery of them towarde the right hande write hys owne diſtaunce from. 10: Then multiple the twoo differences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, the fygure which commeth thereof, ſhall you ſet downe vnder both the differences. But if there be two fygures, ſet downe but the fyrſt, and keepe the other in your minde afterwardes abate (from one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two diget nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers) the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the other diget number that is to ſay, croſſewiſe.

                  <head>¶ The .vii. chapiter treateth of the Rule of .3. called the golden Rule.</head>
                  <p>THe rule of three is the chifeſt the moſte profitable, and the moſte excellent rule of al the rules of Arithmetike. For al other rules haue nede of it, and it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all the other, for the whiche cauſe it is ſaied, that the Philoſophers did name it the golden rule. And after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers opinion and iudgement, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:183994:39"/> the rule of proporcions of noum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But now in theſe daies, by vs it is called the rule of thre, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth three nombers in his operaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of the whiche three nombers, the twoo firſt are ſet in a certain proporci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And in ſoche proporcion as their bée ſtabliſhed, this rule ſerueth to finde out vnto the third nomber, the fourth nomber to hym proporcioned, in ſoche ſort as the ſecond is proporcioned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſte. Not for that, that the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer noumbers, nor yet the three, are or bee proporcionall, or ſet in one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcion, but ſoche proporcion, as is from the firſte to the ſeconde, ought to bee from the thirde vnto the fowerth, that is to ſaie, if the ſeconde noumber dooe conteine the firſte twoo tymes or more, ſo many tymes ſhal the fowerth nomber conteine the thirde. And note well that the firſte nomber, and the thirde in euery rule of three, oughte and muſt bee alwaies ſemblable, and of one condicion. And the ſecond nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb facs="tcp:183994:40"/> and the fowerth muſte likewiſe bee of one ſembleaunce and nature.</p>
                  <p>And are diſſemblaunte, and contrarie to the other twoo noumbers: that is to ſaie to the firſte, and the thirde. And if you dooe multiplie the firſte by the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werth. And the ſeconde noumber by the thirde. The twoo multiplicacions will bee egall. Likewiſe if you diuide the one ſembleaunte by the other, that is to ſaie, the thirde noumber by the firſte. And likewiſe the one diſſemble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunte by the other: that is to ſaie, the fowerth nomber by the ſecond (which are diſſembleaunte to the other twoo nombers) your twoo quocientes will bee egall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Regul.</note>The ſtile of this rule is thus, you muſte ſette doune your three noum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in a certaine order, as by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here vnder ſhall appere. And then multiplie the thirde noumber, by the ſeconde. And the producte thereof you muſte diuide by the firſte noumber, or otherwiſe, diuide the firſte noumber
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:183994:40"/> by the ſeconde. And the quocient ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhalbee diuiſor vnto the third nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is to ſaie, the thirde noumber ſhall bee diuided by the quotient of the foreſaied diuiſion, that is of the firſte noumber diuided by the ſeconde. Or otherwiſe diuide the ſeconde noumber by the firſte. And that whiche cometh into your quotiente, you ſhall multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it by the thirde nomber. And thus ſhall you haue the fowerth noumber, whiche you ſeke for.</p>

                  <p>Likewiſe, in the thyrde example, 97. yardes, at three pence the yarde, bringeth 24. ſhil. 3. pence, in taking the ¼ of 97.

                  <p>Here in this ſame firſt exaumple where it is demaunded (at 5. pence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yard) how much are nine and fourty yardes worth? Fyrſt for foure pence,
<pb facs="tcp:183994:87"/> I take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ⅓ of 49.s. and thereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth 16.s. 4.d. the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for 1.d.

And ſo much are the 49. yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des worth at 5.d. the yard.</p>
                  <p>For 7.d. take the ⅓ and the ¼ of the whole ſumme which is to be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and adde them togither, that is to ſay, for 4.d. the ⅓ and for 3.d. the ¼: bycauſe 4.d. is the ⅓ of 12.d. and 3.d. is the ¼ as in the ſecond example before doth appeare: Where the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is thus, at 7.d. y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yard what are 54. yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des worth? Fyrſt for 4.d. I take the ⅓ of 54: and they make 18.s. Likewyſe for 3.d. I take the ¼ of 54. and they are 13.s. 6.d. Then I adde 18.s. and 13.s. 6. d. togither, ſo both amount to 31.s. 6.d and ſo much are the 54. yardes worth at 5.d. the yarde.</p>
                  <p>Otherwyſe for 7.d. take firſt the ½, of the whole ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me for 6.d. Then for 1.d. take the ⅙ of theſame product, and

                  <p n="3">3. Lykewiſe by the ſame reaſon, when you wil multiply (by ſhillings) anye number that is vnder xx.s. you ſhall haue in the product poundes, if you knowe the certaine partes of 20: which are theſe: 10.5.4.2. &amp;. 1.

                  <p>Then for 10.s. which is the ½ of a pounde: you muſte take the ½ of the number, which is to bee multiplied, and you ſhall haue poundes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. If there doe remaine 1, it ſhalbe worth ten ſhillings.</p>

                  <p>For 4.s. you muſt take the ⅕ of the number which is to bee multiplied. And if there do remaine any vnities, they ſhal be fift parts of a pound eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one being worth four ſhillings.</p>

                  <p>Now in the firſt example, where it is demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, at 8.s. the groſſe, what are 97 groſſe? Firſt the ½ of 8.s. which is 4.s. being ſet apart behind the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked line, as before is ſayd: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 97 by 4. ſaying firſt, 4. times 7. is 28. I double y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diget nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber 8. and
<pb facs="tcp:183994:91"/> that maketh 16, the which 16, I do put vnder the line, in the place of ſhilli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs &amp; I kepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tennes in my mind, which here are 2. For 20. are two times ten: Then ſecondly, I multiply 9, by the ſayd 4, and thereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth 36: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I adde the 2, tennes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dyd reſerue, and they make 38. Therefore I put 38, vnder the lyne in the place of poundes, and the whole ſumme wil be 38. li. 16.s. Thus much are the 97. groſſe worth, at eight ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the groſſe: the like is to be done of all other. As of 12. ſhillings in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying by 6. Likewiſe of 6. ſhillings if you multiply by 3, alſo of 14. if you multiply by 7. And ſo of all euen nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>For 1. Shilling you muſt take the ½ of the 1/10 parte of any number that is to be multiplied.

And therefore ſaye by the rule of three, if the ſeconde marchaunt, of 21 9/11, do make but 20/1 how much ſhall he loſe vpon the 100/1?

                  <p>For your better vnderſtanding of theſe Queſtions, you muſt note that when one marchaunt gaineth of an other after the rate of ten pound vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hundred pound he gaineth the 1/10 of his owne principall, and the other which loſeth after the rate of 9. 1/11 vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hundred he loſeth the 1/11 of his principal. And it may be proued thus: When one marchaunt will ſell hys wares vnto another, which wares ſtande him but in 100. li. &amp; hee will ſell them for 110. li. he, of his 100. li. maketh 110. li. wherfore hee gaineth after 10. li. vpon the 100. which is the 1/10 of hys principall, and the other which byeth

And therefore ſay by the rule of thre, if 110. become of 100. of howe much ſhall come 100? Multiplie and diuide, and you ſhall finde 90.10/11, the which abate from 100: and there reſteth 9.1/11 is the 1/11 of hys principal that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde loſeth vpon the 100. as afore is ſaide. And therefore, who ſo that wil know what one Marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gaineth of another, either after the rate of tenne vpon the hundred, which is the 1/10 of of hys principall, or elſe after the rate of twenty vpon the hundred which is the ⅕, or of any other parte, and that he would likewiſe knowe what part the other loſeth of hys principall: hee muſt take for the numeratour of the broken number of hym that loſeth, as much as for him that gaineth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adde the numerator and the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator (of the broken number of hym that gaineth) both togither, &amp; make thereof the denominator of the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:183994:144"/> number of him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loſeth, &amp; then ſhall you haue the part of him that loſeth, as by exaumple, of him that gayneth after ten. li. vpon the 100. li. which is the 1/10 of hys principall: take the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meratour which is 1. and make that the numerator of the broken number of him that loſeth, then adde 1. which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> numerator of the fraction of him that gaineth with ten, whych is hys denominator, &amp; you ſhall haue 11. for the denominatour of the fraction of him that loſeth. Then put one ouer the 11. and ſo you ſhal haue 1/11. Thus it appereth when one marchant gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of another after ten vppon the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, he gaineth the 1/10 of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, and the other loſeth 9. 1/11 which is the 1/11 of his principall.

                  <p>THe rule of falſehode is ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not for that it teacheth any deceit or falſehode, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by fained numbers taken at al adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures, it teacheth to finde out the true nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is demaunded. And this (of all the vulgare Rules which are in practiſe) is the moſt excellent: this rule hath two partes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one is of one falſe poſition alone: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other is of two poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as hereafter ſhal appere</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:183994:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Thoſe queſtions which are done by falſe poſitions, haue theyr opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in a maner like vnto that of the rule of three, but only that in the rule of three, we haue thre numbers kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and here in thys rule wee haue but one (I meane that commeth in operation) vnto the likenes whereof wee muſte diuiſe two other, the one multiplying, and the other diuiding, as by example.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I haue deliuered to a banker a certeine ſumme of poundes in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to haue of hym by the yeare 6. li. vpon the 100. li. And at the ende of 10. yeares, he paide mee 500. li. for al both principal and gaine. I demaund how much was the principall ſumme that I deliuered at the fyrſt. Here you ſee that there are diuers termes: but the chiefe to worke with all is 500. pound which commeth of the other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that is to ſaye, of 10. and 100. for of them is compounde the tenour
<pb facs="tcp:183994:157"/> of the queſtion, the practiſe whereof is thus.</p>
                  <p>Let vs faine a number at pleaſure, and wyth the ſame let vs make oure diſcourſe, euen as though it were the principall ſumme that wee ſeeke for. As by Example. Suppoſe that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt 200. li. the which were worth to me in ten yeres. 120. li. after the rate of 6. li. vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hundred pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 120. li. added with 200. li. Do make but 320. li. and I muſt haue 500. pound. Thus you ſee that I haue three termes for the rule of three: the one which ſhall conteine the Queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other two, which I haue formed artificially, which are 200. and 320: in ſuch ſort, that 320. ought to haue ſuch proportion to 200, as 500. hath vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number that I ſeeke: that is to ſaye, vnto the true principall ſumme, then muſt I haue recourſe vnto the rule of thre, after this ſorte, ſaying.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:183994:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>If 320. li. become of 200. li. of howe much ſhall come 500. li. Multiply 500. by 200. and thei are 100000. the which you ſhall diuide by 320. li. and thereof commeth 312. li. ½ which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſumme that I deliuer at the firſt. And thus, this rule hath ſome congruence with the double rule of three.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I haue a Ceſterne with 3. vnegal cockes conteining 60. pipes of water: And if the greateſt cocke bee opened, the water wyll auoide cleane in one houre, at the ſeconde it wyll auoide in twoo houres, and at the thyrde it will require three houres. Nowe I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in what ſpace wil it auoide, all the cocks being ſet open. Suppoſe that it will auoide in halfe an houre, that is to ſay, in 30. minutes. Then muſt there auoide at the fyrſte cocke the ½, which is thirtye pipes, and by the ſeconde cocke the ¼ whiche is 15, pipes, and by the thirde cocke the ⅙, that is tenne pypes, all the whych
<pb facs="tcp:183994:158"/> ſummes being added togither dooe make 55. pipes, but it ſhoulde bee 60. pipes. Therefore I ſay by the rule of three, if 55. pipes doe voide in 30. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes: in how many minuts wil 60. pipes voide? Multiplie and diuide, &amp; you ſhall finde 32. minutes 40/55. And in that ſpace will the water auoide if all the cockes be ſet open.</p>
